- **► Orange arrow**: File exists only in RIGHT directory **[RIGHT ONLY]**

## 📄 Supported File Types

The tool intelligently detects and compares 50+ text file types:

### Programming Languages
`.go` `.js` `.ts` `.py` `.java` `.c` `.cpp` `.h` `.hpp` `.rs` `.swift` `.kt` `.cs` `.vb` `.fs` `.php` `.rb` `.scala` `.clj` `.hs` `.elm` `.pl` `.pm` `.r` `.R` `.m`

### Web & Data Files  
`.html` `.htm` `.css` `.xml` `.json` `.yaml` `.yml` `.toml` `.csv`

### Documentation & Text
`.txt` `.md` `.rst` `.tex` `.org`

### Configuration & Scripts
`.conf` `.ini` `.cfg` `.sh` `.bash` `.zsh` `.fish` `.ps1` `.bat` `.cmd`

### Build & Project Files
`.dockerfile` `.makefile` `.cmake` `.ninja` `.gradle` `.pom` `.gitignore` `.gitattributes` `.editorconfig`

### Special Files (no extension)
`README` `LICENSE` `CHANGELOG` `AUTHORS` `CONTRIBUTORS` `Dockerfile` `Gemfile` `Rakefile` `Procfile`

## How It Works

1. **Load Paths**: Enter file or directory paths in the input fields
2. **Analyze All Files**: For directories, the tool finds ALL text files from both locations
3. **Categorize Files**: Files are marked as common (both sides), left-only, or right-only
4. **Select File**: Choose any file to compare using the arrow keys
5. **View Diff**: See the comparison with color-coded changes
6. **Navigate**: Move through all files (common and unique) seamlessly
7. **Merge Changes**: Press 'm' to enter merge mode (only for common files)
8. **Save Results**: Choose which changes to keep and save the merged file

## Examples

### Comparing Two Files
```bash
./filecmp config.old.yaml config.new.yaml
```

### Comparing Project Directories
```bash
./filecmp ./project-v1 ./project-v2
```
This will find all files from both directories and allow you to compare them, merge changes, and copy unique files.

### Interactive Mode
```bash
./filecmp
```
Then enter paths interactively using the TUI.

### Copy Unique Files Between Directories
```bash
# Compare directories and copy unique files
./filecmp old-project/ new-project/
# Press 'c' to enter copy mode
# Select files to copy and press 's' to copy them
```
