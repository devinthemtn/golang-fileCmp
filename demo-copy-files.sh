# Deployment Guide v2.0

This guide explains how to deploy the new version.
Should be copied to the old version for reference.

## Prerequisites
- Docker 20.0+
- Kubernetes 1.18+
- Node.js 16+

## Deployment Steps
1. Build the application
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:2.0 .
   ```

2. Deploy to staging
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
   ```

3. Run migrations
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it deployment/myapp -- npm run migrate
   ```

4. Deploy to production
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
   ```

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, rollback to previous version:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
```

echo "How Copy Mode Works:"
echo "==================="
echo "1️⃣  Press 'c' from file selection to enter Copy Mode"
